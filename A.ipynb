    "    Pre-pruning, or early stopping, is a technique in decision trees that halts the growth of a tree during its construction to prevent overfitting. This is achieved by setting conditions that stop the tree-building process before it becomes too complex, such as limiting the maximum depth, requiring a minimum number of samples per node, or stopping when a split no longer provides significant impurity decrease.\n",
    "\n",
    "    How it works\n",
    "Stopping the growth: Pre-pruning involves stopping the tree from growing beyond a certain point, rather than waiting for it to be fully built and then trimming it. \n",
    "Setting conditions: Conditions are set beforehand to determine when to stop. These can include: \n",
    "Maximum depth: Limiting the maximum number of layers in the tree. \n",
    "Minimum samples per leaf: Stopping when the number of samples in a node is below a certain threshold. \n",
    "Minimum samples per split: Requiring a minimum number of samples to split a node. \n",
    "Minimum impurity decrease: Halting the split if it does not meet a minimum decrease in impurity, such as Gini impurity or information gain. \n",
    "Preventing overfitting: By stopping the tree early, it prevents the model from becoming too complex and memorizing noise in the training data, which leads to better generalization on unseen data. \n",
    "Risk of underfitting: A potential drawback is that stopping the tree too early can lead to underfitting, where the model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data. "

    "\n",
    "SVM works by finding the best decision boundary (called a hyperplane) that separates data points of different classes with the maximum margin.\n",

    "🔹 Key Idea:\n",

    "SVM aims to maximize the margin between classes while minimizing classification error.\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes the classifier more robust and generalizable to new data.\n",
